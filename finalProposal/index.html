    <h1>Project Title: Accessible Web: A Guide to Inclusive Web Design</h1>
    <h2>Short Written Description</h2>
    <p>
        The internet is a vast repository of knowledge, opportunities, and resources. However, not all users have equal access to this information superhighway due to varying physical, cognitive, and environmental conditions. Web accessibility is the practice of ensuring that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can use the Web effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        For my final project, I propose to create a dynamic website that champions the cause of Internet accessibility. This website will serve as an educational tool on the importance of accessible web design, showcasing best practices and demonstrating ways to make web content accessible to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website will itself exemplify accessible design principles. Key features will include a high-contrast mode to aid users with visual impairments, a text-to-speech function to assist individuals with reading difficulties, and a responsive design to accommodate various screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site will also provide interactive learning experiences, such as quizzes on accessibility knowledge, and demonstrations of various accessibility features. By engaging users in this way, the site will not only inform about accessibility but will also demonstrate these principles in action.
